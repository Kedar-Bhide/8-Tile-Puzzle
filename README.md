# 8-Tile-Puzzle

The 8-tile puzzle was invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3x3 grid with 8 tiles labeled 1 through 8 and an empty grid. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order. The 8-tile puzzle was invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s.

The goal state of the puzzle is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0].
This puzzle is solved by using the A* Search algorithm. The sum of the Manhattan distance of each tile to its goal position is the heuristic function. The Manhattan distance in this case is the sum of the absolute difference of their x co-ordinates and y co-ordinates. The implementation is able to solve any given valid puzzle in the most efficeint manner, using least possible moves.
